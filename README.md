# Castle-Defence
Game where you need to defend your tower against attackers
It would be cool to have it even for mobile.

HOW IT WILL WORK:__________________________________________________
As a player on top of tower, you can shoot with a bow(unlimited arrows).
There will be waves of enemies and each round they will increase.
For each enemy that got killed, player will gain some gold.
Player can buy/summon friendly characters to help him
If enemies drop the health of the gate to zero, Player lose

WHAT IS NEEDED:____________________________________________________
-ASSETS-
- Player with bow.
- arrow png.
- gold coin image
- Background image.
- Castle with visible gates on right side image.
- A few types of enemies. let say 5/6 from weakest to strongest. I think orcs can do the trick. Enemies and allies are ordered from weakest to strongest.

_Enemies_
- Goblin with club
- Light armored Orc with axe
- Medium armored Orc with mace
- Heavy armored Orc with with Two handed sword

_Summoned allies_
- Peasant with fork
- Militia with one handed sword
- Archer with bow. he stop in front of a gate and start shooting
- Lower Knight with sword and shield
- Armored Knight with Two handed sword that can shoot once with crossbow before contact with enemy. Crossbow instantly kills till 2 level enemy
- Mage - can be used to oneshot everyone till level 3 in a visible map.


GAME LOGIC:
player starts with 100 coins
on a first round 15 Goblin enemies will come one by one and if they will get to the gate then they will stop and attacking animation will occur each second.
enemy goes to left and allies goes to right. if they meet they will stop and attacking animation occurs. if any one of thm survived then they starts to go again.
Arrow deals 2 damage
